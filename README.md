# Sign-Language-Recognition Project

<br>

**Introduction**

A project that will help you convert sign language to english alphabets. We have developed 2 interfaces :- detection in realtime and an application deployed using Flask where you can either upload an image of a sign language or you can click photos and then predict.

**Dataset Used**

The dataset used for training the project is a self developed one. We used mediapipe to create the same. Below are some pics of the dataset.
